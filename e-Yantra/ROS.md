## Linux
• Linux is a family of open source and community-developed operating systems which is widely used in computers, servers, mainframes, mobile devices and embedded devices.
• Linux is a UNIX-style operating system written in C and Assembly by Linus Trovalds and Linux Community.
• There are many flavors of Linux OS like, Debian, Ubuntu, Arch, Kali, Linux Mint.
• Both Linux and macOS are UNIX based OS whereas modern Windows OSes are NT based.
• In this eYRC Theme we are going to use Ubuntu 20.04.

#### Linux File System Directories
• **`root`** is the beginning or the top point of the Unix File System under which directories important to a Unix OS resides. It is different from a root user of the system.


• Each directory contains a set of files and programs which are required for the proper functioning of the OS.


• Out of all the directories, **`/home/`** and **`/opt/`** are two important directories for this eYRC Theme.


• **`/opt/`** is the directory or folder where the packages or software which you are going to install using package manager (apt-get in Ubuntu) is going to reside.


• **`/home/`** is the folder where all your personal files including project files are going to reside.


• **`/bin/`** is the folder where most common Linux commands reside. Commands like ls, chmodetc.
